# TIC TAC TOE

# Project Description

Tic Tac Toe is a 3x3 board game with two players.
Players are assigned symbols between X and O.
Players take turns to play their symbols in a empty cell.
The first player to fill an entire row, column or diagonal wins.
If no player fills it and the board is full, it's a draw.
